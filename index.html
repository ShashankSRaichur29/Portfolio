            <p>This project predicts the risk of suffering from heart disease among the elderly by exploring the feasibility of using logistic regression models. Through the technology of data mining, the main pathogenic factors of heart disease were found, and the incidence of heart disease was predicted by using the regression model. The accuracy of logistic regression model was compared with other explored algorithms, and I found that the logistic regression model was worthy of research in the field of heart disease prediction.And Display the result through a website with a user friendly UI.</p>

            <p>As streaming is increasingly being adopted by users, online media players have become essential for consuming media on the internet. Music players allow one to enjoy music in any browser and supports a lot of the features of an offline music player.
              We will be creating a music player with a clean user interface that can be used to play music in the browser. We will also implement features like seeking and volume control. HTML has several methods in the HTMLMediaElement interface that can be used to play audio files and control its playback without using any other library.
              We will start by creating the HTML layout first that defines the structure of the player, make it look good by styling using CSS and then write the player logic for all the functions in JavaScript.</p>

            <p>The smart stick for the blind as the name suggests is a device for the visually impaired to guide the user to respective destination and avoiding to collide with the obstacles. It uses two ultrasonic sensors HC SR 04 to detect the depth below or the obstacles in between. Along with that it uses Arduino as the main controller. And 1sheeld as the Bluetooth interface between the controller and smartphone. Whenever there is any obstacle in front. The sensor will detect the distance from the obstacle and send to the controller. The controller will then convert in audio format.</p>
